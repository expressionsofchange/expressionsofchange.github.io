            <p class="intro"><em>Expressions of Change</em> is a research project that aims to radically improve the tools for constructing ever-changing computer programs.
</p>
          </hgroup>
        </header>

        <p>The need for such a project stems from two observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Computer programs <em>will</em> be changed</strong> — and managing those changes themselves forms a large part of a computer programmer’s work.</li>
  <li><strong>Existing tools are afterthoughts</strong> — the creation of Version Management Systems postdates the programming languages whose programs’ versions they manage.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fact that most computer programs are destined to evolve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman%27s_laws_of_software_evolution">has been well known since at least 1974</a>. This has only become more obvious since then, so much that currently popular paradigms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a> even put it at the core of their philosophy.</p>

<p>The basic building block of programming, however, does not acknowledge this ever-changing nature: to the compiler a program appears as one or more historyless text files.</p>

<p>Because of the central importance of software evolution, <a href="/existing-tools/">a myriad of tools has sprung up to manage it</a>. However, these tools invariably take historyless files as a given and proceed to add history on top of it. They are therefore doomed to yield incomplete solutions.</p>

<h3 id="design-goals">Design goals</h3>

<p>The design goals of this project follow directly from the problem definition above. By not accepting history-less files as a basic building block we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Change</strong> to the program itself should be a <strong>primitive</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Combining</strong> arbitrarily sized parts of programs <strong>across time</strong> should be possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arbitrarily combining parts of programs across time is a radical new idea. Here are just a few examples of what becomes possible in that paradigm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refactoring a function definition while postponing to update some of the calling locations.</li>
  <li>Real-time large team cooperation on a single codebase — modules that are currently being edited by others can be referenced or ignored at will.</li>
  <li>Reproducing bugs by simply replaying them — any version of the program is referencable and executable; combined with a reference to the data reproducing bugs becomes trivial.</li>
  <li>Using multiple different versions of the same external or internal library across a single program.</li>
  <li>Running 2 or more versions of the program simultaneously, switching out one of them gradually.</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more…</p>

<h3 id="implementation-direction">Implementation direction</h3>

<p>The main goal of the project is to demonstrate a prototype that is an implementation of the design goals mentioned above — i.e. some sort of <em>Programming Language</em>.</p>

<p>Because the project rejects the history-less file as a basic building block, the first step towards this is to build an <em>editor</em> that constructs the primitives of change instead.</p>

<p>For practical reasons (the scope of the project is large enough as it stands), the first editor will only supports constructions a minimal syntax: S-Expressions.</p>

<p>Whether a more advanced syntax is required, e.g. to be able to express type information properly, is an open question.</p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>This is an ongoing project. Progress will be documented on this site in two forms:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/recent/">Articles</a> describing the progress of the project and its philosophical underpinnings.</li>
  <li>Demo (research) implementations.  A very first version of this editor has been built in the first months of 2017; it will be presented on this site in July.</li>
</ol>
