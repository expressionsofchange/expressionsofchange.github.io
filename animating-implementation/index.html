            <p class="intro">In the previous article we have seen how we can show animations in the history pane of the editor to subtly illustrate how the construction of different levels of our program relate to each other. Here we provide some notes on these animations are implemented.

        <h2 id="what-are-history-animations">What are history-animations?</h2>

<p>History-animations build on the following feature (one that was already existing):
whenever we select an s-expression in our “tree” (the structural
view on the right hand side of the window) we show the history of that
particular s-expression in the panel on the left. That is, whenever we change the cursor in
the tree, we switch what is shown in the history.</p>

<p>The animation under discussion: any part of history that shows up both before
and after this switch will “float” from its pre-switch position to its
post-switch position in a number of steps. The idea is to make it visually more
clear that there is a relationship between the histories at different levels of
the tree.</p>

<p>More details and examples can be found in a <a href="/animating-history-transitions/">separate
article</a>. In the present article we’ll zoom in
on the implementation.</p>

<p>The current version of the editor supports 2 versions of rendering histories:
one in which the histories are rendered as s-expressions themselves, as
presented in the paper <a href="/assets/papers/clef-design.pdf">the paper “Clef
Design”</a>; one in which the effects of each note
are shown in the context of the structure on which it is played (i.e.: more
like a traditional rendering of a <em>diff</em>). Animations of transitions are
implemented for both of these; where the implementations diverge this will be
pointed out in the below.</p>

<h2 id="identity-of-notes-and-textures">Identity of notes and textures</h2>

<p>The key idea in the animations is to float textures from some pre-switch to a
post-switch location. This hinges on the assumption that we have a shared
identity for the textures pre- and post-switch. E.g. to float some open-bracket
from one location to the next, we need to know which open-bracket we’re talking
about (there are many, and they look very similar).</p>

<p>Note that the particular animation under consideration is the following: when
swichting which part of our structural view (the “tree”) is selected, update
the historical view.</p>

<p>Thus, the assumption of shared identity, in this case, is: there is overlap
between the histories of different parts of our tree. For each of the elements
(notes) of the history we can establish an identity, and when viewing a
different history, we can establish whether any two notes across these two
histories are the same one, i.e. share this identity.</p>

<p>The fact that parts of histories are shared across different parts of our
structure is detailed in <a href="/assets/papers/clef-design.pdf">the paper “Clef
Design”</a></p>

<p>In terms of the implementation, the solution is to have some addressing scheme
for the textures that is global in the sense that it is shared between the
pre-and post-switch environments.  Using this addressing scheme we can identify
textures: same address means same texture.</p>

<p>Such an addressing scheme for textures is obtained in a number of steps.</p>

<h3 id="noteaddress">NoteAddress</h3>

<p>The first step is to annotate each note in the “global history” (the history of
the whole tree) in such a way that we can uniquely identify each note.
<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/dsn/s_expr/clef_address.py#L154">Implementation</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/widgets/history.py#L161">calling</a>
<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/widgets/ic_history.py#L322">locations</a></p>

<p>The formalization of the note-address is implemented in the class <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/4e519b03dee1d5e166565519b1c910afdce8d19c/dsn/s_expr/note_address.py#L6"><code class="highlighter-rouge">NoteAddress</code></a></p>

<p>The intuition here is: when the whole history is written out as an expression,
the address of a particular note is a path trough that expression. An example
could be: of the global score, take the 6th item; of that item take the only
child, of that item again take the only child. The 2 main possible parts of such
paths are: the <em>nth</em> item of a Score, and the only child. <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/4e519b03dee1d5e166565519b1c910afdce8d19c/doctests/note_address.txt">The
doctests</a>
provide further details.</p>

<h3 id="push-global-noteaddress-to-the-tree">Push global NoteAddress to the tree</h3>

<p>In the second step, we construct a tree by playing this global history of notes,
annotated with their global address
(<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/widgets/history.py#L163">here</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/widgets/ic_history.py#L324">here</a>).
We use the regular mechanism of playing a score to get a tree (<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/dsn/s_expr/clef_address.py#L167">This
one</a>
– in fact, it’s not 100% identical for implementation reasons, as documented
in the code, but in terms of behavior it is). The only difference is: because the
input Notes have now been annotated with a global address, the scores as
constructed at each sub-expression in the resulting tree are now consisting of
notes which have a global address. This means that when we fetch the “local
score” (the score to be rendered) we have information about the global address
of each note.</p>

<h3 id="texture-addresses">Texture-addresses</h3>

<p>Finally, we make sure to keep the annotations around in each step of the
conversion to textures, as well as add conversion-specific information when
needed. The implementations of this final step are unique for each of the two
different styles of rendering.</p>

<h4 id="els18-style-rendering">ELS’18 style rendering</h4>

<p>In the case rendering of in the style of the ELS’18 paper, the tree of notes is
first converted to an s-expr, and these s-expressions are then converted to the
actual textures with locations.</p>

<p>We need step-specific address information for each of these steps. When converting to
an s-expression, we annotate the elements that are specific to the fact that the
note is being rendered as an s-expression (i.e. the fact that the Note’s fields
and its type, when converted to an s-expression, turn into particular
further s-expressions). <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/dsn/s_expr/clef_address.py#L31">Let’s consider the case of <code class="highlighter-rouge">become-atom</code> as an
example</a>:
when the note <code class="highlighter-rouge">(become-atom foo)</code> is represented as an s-expression the whole
s-expression is annotated as representing the whole note (by not providing any
further annotation), the atom <code class="highlighter-rouge">become-atom</code> is annotated as being the name of
the note, and the atom <code class="highlighter-rouge">foo</code> is annotated as being the field <code class="highlighter-rouge">atom</code> of that
note.</p>

<p>When converting these s-expressions to textures similar further annotations
are necessary. For example: a list-expression is rendered as 2 textures, one
for <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/widgets/history.py#L348">each</a> <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/e7a74705c7de/widgets/history.py#L361">bracket</a></p>

<p>A particular property of this style of rendering histories, is that the
recursive nature of the histories is preserved in the rendering. That is: a note
may contain further notes; when the note is rendered, the notes it contains are
also rendered.</p>

<p>With regards to the assignment of addresses to textures, the implication is
straightforward: each rendered note is assigned with the address of that
particular note.</p>

<p>An example is drawn below: if the chord below is the item at position 1 in some
other history, the children of that chord are at some subpath.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(chord ((insert 0 (become-list)) (extend 0 (insert 0 (become-list)))))
^       ^                        ^
|       |                        |
(@1) (@1, @0)                 (@1, @1)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The effect of this approach on the animation is precisely as intended: when
switching from a larger context to a smaller one, the “surrounding” notes that
are not applicable in the smaller context float out of view; but those that are
applicable in both views (the inner ones), float from their old position on the
screen to the new one. (The reverse applies when switching from a smaller
context to one surrounding it)</p>

<p><img src="/images/movies/transitions-clef-design.gif" alt="Surrounding context disappears." /></p>

<h4 id="ic-history">IC History</h4>

<p>Another way of rendering notes is by rendering them “in their structural
context”. That is: by showing their effect on the existing structure on which
they are being played. This is how <em>diffs</em> are traditionally displayed.</p>

<p>In this view, the recursive nature of notes is not made explicit.  For each note
in some list of notes (for example: those that make up a single score), the
effect of each indivual note on a structure are grouped together. The fact each
such note may itself be composed of any number of other notes is left implict.</p>

<p>Thus, when switching from a larger historical context to a smaller one, it is
not the case that some surrounding <em>notes</em> disappear, while notes contained by
them remain in view.</p>

<p>There simply is no direct rendering of notes in this view: everything that is
rendered is a structure and some effects on that structure. This means that any
addressing must also apply to such structures. And that any floating of related
elements is always floating of some structural element.</p>

<p>It is at this structural level that a similar effect as in the above, of
surrounding context disappearing, can be seen: when switching to a smaller
structural context, less surrounding structure is shown in the in-context
rendering of history, and vise versa for switching to a larger, surrounding,
context:</p>

<p><img src="/images/movies/transition-9.gif" alt="Transition of '9'." /></p>

<p>The implentation details are in the implementing class,
<a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/4e519b03dee1/dsn/s_expr/in_context_display.py#L45"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ICHAddress</code></a>.</p>

<p>The mixing of ‘construction’ and ‘structure’ is reflected in the address of the
rendered elements; each rendered element is denoted first by the note which it
represents (in terms of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">NoteAddress</code>), and second by an address (<code class="highlighter-rouge">t_address</code>,
for stability over time) in the tree. (further steps in the rendering chain add
further details, i.e.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">icd_specific</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">render_specific</code>)</p>

<p>One final caveat: the NoteAddress <code class="highlighter-rouge">NoteAddress</code> part of this <code class="highlighter-rouge">ICHAddress</code> is
always the address of the <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf1/blob/4e519b03dee1/widgets/ic_history.py#L91">deepest</a> (leaf-most) possible note. For example, when
rendering the note <code class="highlighter-rouge">(extend 0 (insert 0 (become-list)))</code>, the address of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">(become-list)</code> is used in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ICHAddress</code>.  This ensures we have a singular
identity across context-switches. (It is only this deepest NoteAddress that can
be relied on to always be availalble).</p>

<h3 id="the-animation">The animation</h3>

<p>The actual animation is rather straightforward: do a linear interpolation for
(source, target) for the attributes (x, y, alpha).</p>

<p>We set a clock at an interval (I’ve set 1/60, but I’m not actually getting this
<em>at all</em> on my local machine).  Kivy will tell you how much time has actually
passed since the last tick. We then calculate the fraction <code class="highlighter-rouge">dt / remaining_time</code>.
This approach is automatically robust for missed frames (i.e. the missed frame
will not be rendered, but the total animation time and the position of the
texture at the next frame are unaffected)</p>
