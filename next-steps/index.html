        <h3 id="1-demonstration-of-chords">1. Demonstration of Chords</h3>

<p>One important aspect of composition in <em>Expressions of Change</em> is the idea of “history at any level”. A visual demonstration of that idea has been given in <a href="/animating-history-transitions/">a previous article</a>.</p>

<p>An even more direct mechanism is that of <em>Chords</em>: arbitrary hierarchical groupings of multiple related notes. The history pane of the editor already supports expansion &amp; collapsing of chords. I would like to demonstrate this in a separate post (which should include animated gifs or a video).</p>

<h3 id="2-demonstration-of-static-analysis">2. Demonstration of static analysis</h3>

<p>As part of <a href="https://github.com/expressionsofchange/nerf0">Nerf 0</a> I have added quite a few examples of Static Analysis, such as unused variable analysis and undefined variable analysis.</p>

<p>One of the ideas of <em>Expressions of Change</em> is that the approach of the project makes it possible to say <em>when</em> an error occured as well as <em>where</em>. I would like to prove this idea “by example”.</p>

<p>For this it is necessary to create a visual representation of the static analyses, as well as a visual representation of their “deltas” (such as “variable becomes defined in this change”, “variable becomes undefined in this change”).</p>

<h3 id="3-demonstrate-understanding-through-refactoring">3. Demonstrate “understanding through refactoring”</h3>

<p>It is one of the core tenets of <em>Expressions of Change</em> that code is in part understood in its historical context.</p>

<p>To illustrate this idea, as well as illustrate some cool CS concepts, it would be nice to record a number of explanations-through-refactoring using <a href="/the-editor/">the editor</a>.</p>

<p>Examples could be: the derivation of the <a href="https://mvanier.livejournal.com/2897.html">Y Combinator by Mike Vanier</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/44Z2buIu9cE?t=14m22s">my own explanation of the concept of a catamorphism using consecutive refactorings</a></p>

<h3 id="4-animations-of-structure">4. Animations of “structure”</h3>

<p><em>Expressions of Change</em> introduces a full new dimension to programming: that of the time of programming construction. One question that follows directly from this observation is: “how can we visualize this dimension for our users?”</p>

<p>One answer is: by using animations, an example being the <a href="/animating-history-transitions/">animations of how various histories relate to each other</a>.</p>

<p>An even more direct animation would be: animating program change itself (rather than the more traditional form of visualising program change: the diff).</p>

<p>Such animations would at least provide an answer to the question: “how can be visualize that a move is just a move, rather than the combination of removing something and then re-adding it elsewhere?”</p>

<p>4.b] Such animations can also be tied to the idea of a (secondary) tree “following history”, i.e. showing the state at whatever point in time was selected in the history cursor.</p>

<h3 id="5-demonstration-of-self-applicability">5. Demonstration of self-applicability</h3>

<p>I have complained in the past that modern <a href="http://www.expressionsofchange.org/self-applicability/">Version Control Systems cannot be applied to themselves</a>, i.e. that when rewriting history in Git, you lose precisely the ability to undo mistakes that Git gives you.</p>

<p><em>Expressions of Change</em> does not suffer from this limitation: it is trivially possible to edit the expressions that constitute the description of history by using another layer of history.</p>

<p>It would be nice to actually demonstrate this in the editor.</p>
